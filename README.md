# Machine-Learning-Project
This repository contains code pertaining to a machine learning project done for CS185C (Introduction to Machine Learning) at SJSU; completed Fall 2019. 

## Analyzing Classical Ciphers with Machine Learning
The goal of this project is to use machine learning to analyze various classical ciphers. In the process of analyzing ciphertexts obtained from these ciphers, the desired outcome is to use machine learning to try to crack the ciphertexts, as well as to try to figure out what cipher produced a particular ciphertext.
